---

## Course Enrollment Workflow

1. Student selects course
2. Enrollment record created
3. Seat count updated
4. Faculty notified automatically

---

## Attendance Workflow

1. Faculty uploads attendance
2. Attendance records update
3. Flow checks attendance percentage
4. Alerts generated below 75%

---

## Fee Payment Workflow

# Reporting and Dashboard Ideas

## Student Dashboard
- Attendance percentage
- Course enrollment details
- Fee payment status

---

## Faculty Dashboard
- Assigned courses
- Student attendance reports
- Pending approvals

---

## Admin Dashboard
- Admission statistics
- Fee collection reports
- Department performance analytics

---

# Example Reports

| Report | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Attendance Report | Track attendance percentage |
| Fee Pending Report | Identify unpaid fees |
| Enrollment Report | Monitor course registrations |
| Performance Report | Analyze student performance |

# Failure Handling Ideas

Enterprise systems must handle failures carefully to maintain reliability.

## Failure Handling Approaches

- Input validation before processing
- Error messages for invalid data
- Exception handling in Apex
- Retry mechanisms for integrations
- Backup and recovery planning
- Debug logs for troubleshooting

---

# Example Failure Scenario

## Payment Failure

If payment gateway response fails:
- Transaction status marked as failed
- User receives notification
- Retry option provided
- Error stored in logs

This improves reliability and user experience.

# Scalability Discussion

The system is designed to support large-scale enterprise operations.

## Scalability Features

- Batch Apex for bulk processing
- Asynchronous processing
- Efficient SOQL queries
- Reusable LWC components
- Proper indexing and relationships
- Modular architecture

---

# Enterprise Scaling Considerations

As the number of students and records increases:
- Automation must remain optimized
- Queries must avoid governor limits
- Background jobs should handle large data volumes
- Dashboards should support real-time analytics

Proper architecture improves long-term scalability.

# Reflection

This phase helped me understand how a complete enterprise Salesforce system is designed and managed.

I learned:
- Enterprise architecture planning
- Workflow automation
- Approval process management
- Dashboard and reporting concepts
- Failure handling strategies
- Scalability considerations

The most interesting part was learning how frontend, backend, automation, approvals, and reporting combine to create a scalable CRM application.
