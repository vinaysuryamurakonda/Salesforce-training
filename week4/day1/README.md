# Day 1 – Debugging and Best Practices

## Common Bug Scenarios

Developers may face different types of bugs while building Salesforce applications.

Common bug scenarios include:
- Validation rule errors
- Incorrect field updates
- Duplicate records
- Flow automation conflicts
- Trigger recursion issues
- Incorrect SOQL queries
- LWC component rendering issues
- Permission and access errors

These bugs can affect application performance and business processes.

# Debugging Approach

Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors in an application.

## Common Debugging Steps

1. Identify the issue
2. Reproduce the error
3. Check logs and error messages
4. Analyze business logic
5. Fix the issue
6. Retest the application

# Salesforce Debugging Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Debug Logs | Track system execution |
| Developer Console | Analyze code and queries |
| Flow Debugger | Test flow execution |
| Browser Console | Debug LWC JavaScript |
| VS Code Debugging | Debug Apex and LWC |

# Performance Discussion

Performance is important because enterprise applications handle large amounts of data and users.

Poor performance can cause:
- Slow page loading
- Delayed automation
- System crashes
- Governor limit issues
- Poor user experience

---

# Performance Optimization Ideas

- Avoid SOQL inside loops
- Use bulkified Apex code
- Reduce unnecessary automation
- Optimize queries
- Use lazy loading in LWC
- Minimize API calls

Good performance improves scalability and reliability.

# LWC Best Practices

## Component Design
- Create reusable components
- Keep components small and modular

---

## JavaScript Best Practices
- Avoid unnecessary re-rendering
- Use proper event handling
- Write clean and readable code

---

## Data Handling
- Use Apex efficiently
- Minimize server calls
- Cache data when possible

---

## UI Best Practices
- Improve responsiveness
- Use consistent design
- Display user-friendly error messages

---

# Example LWC Issue

## Problem
Attendance dashboard not updating properly.

## Debugging Process
- Check Apex response
- Verify component event handling
- Inspect browser console errors
- Validate data binding

# Best Practices Table

| Best Practice | Benefit |
|---------------|---------|
| Write reusable code | Easier maintenance |
| Use proper naming conventions | Better readability |
| Test components regularly | Improve reliability |
| Optimize queries | Better performance |
| Handle errors properly | Improve user experience |

# Reflection

Today I learned how debugging and best practices improve Salesforce application quality and performance.

I understood:
- Common bug scenarios
- Structured debugging approaches
- Performance optimization techniques
- LWC development best practices
- Importance of scalable and maintainable code

The most interesting topic was learning how performance optimization affects enterprise applications handling large amounts of data.
