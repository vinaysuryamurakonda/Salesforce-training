# Reflection

This mini project helped me understand how multiple Salesforce technologies work together in a real CRM system.

I learned:
- CRM architecture
- Data modeling
- Validation rules
- Flow automation
- Apex logic
- LWC frontend development
- End-to-end system workflow

The most interesting part was understanding how automation, frontend components, and backend logic combine to build scalable enterprise applications.
