# Day 1 – Testing and Asynchronous Processing

## Why Testing Matters

Testing is important in Salesforce because it ensures that applications work correctly and reliably before deployment.

Testing helps:
- Identify bugs and errors
- Validate business logic
- Improve system reliability
- Prevent incorrect data processing
- Ensure automation works properly

Salesforce requires at least 75% Apex test coverage before production deployment.

# What is Asynchronous Processing?

Asynchronous processing allows tasks to run in the background instead of executing immediately.

It is used for:
- Large data processing
- Scheduled operations
- External integrations
- Long-running tasks

Asynchronous processing improves system performance and helps avoid governor limit issues.

# Types of Asynchronous Processing

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Future Method | Run background tasks |
| Queueable Apex | Handle complex async jobs |
| Batch Apex | Process large datasets |
| Scheduled Apex | Execute jobs at scheduled times |

# Important Test Cases

| Test Case | Scenario | Expected Result |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Student Admission Test | Create student record | Student ID generated and email sent |
| Attendance Alert Test | Attendance below 75% | Warning notification triggered |
| Fee Payment Test | Student completes payment | Payment status updated and receipt generated |
| Course Enrollment Test | Student enrolls in course | Enrollment record created successfully |
| Batch Upload Test | Upload large attendance records | Batch Apex processes records without errors |

---

# Async Use Cases

## Fee Reminder Scheduler
Scheduled Apex sends automatic fee reminders daily.

---

## Bulk Attendance Processing
Batch Apex processes thousands of attendance records efficiently.

---

## External Payment Integration
Future methods call payment gateway APIs asynchronously.

---

## Student Report Generation
Queueable Apex generates reports in the background.

# Reliability Discussion

Reliable systems are important because enterprise applications manage large amounts of business data daily.

Testing and asynchronous processing improve reliability by:
- Reducing system failures
- Improving performance
- Handling large-scale operations
- Preventing data corruption
- Supporting real-time automation

Without proper testing and background processing, systems may become slow and unstable.

# Reflection

Today I learned why testing is critical in Salesforce development and how asynchronous processing improves performance in enterprise systems.

I understood:
- Importance of test coverage
- Different types of asynchronous Apex
- Real-world async use cases
- How reliability affects system quality

The most interesting topic was learning how Batch Apex processes large datasets efficiently.
