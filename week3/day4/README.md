## Approval Workflow Examples

### Student Leave Approval Workflow
1. Student submits leave request
2. Faculty advisor reviews request

4. Student receives notification

---

### Fee Discount Approval Workflow
1. Student requests fee concession
2. Finance department reviews application
3. Management approves or rejects request
4. Fee status updates automatically

---

### Course Enrollment Approval Workflow

# Branching Flow Logic

Branching logic allows flows to take different paths based on conditions.

### Example – Attendance Alert Flow

- If attendance >= 75%
  - No action required

- If attendance < 75%
  - Send warning email
  - Notify faculty advisor

# Example Branching Diagram

```text
Attendance Check
        |
   ----------------
   |              |
 >=75%         <75%
   |              |
No Action    Send Alert

# Governance Explanation

Governance in Salesforce means following best practices, rules, and limits to ensure applications remain stable, secure, and scalable.

Governance helps:
- Prevent system failures
- Maintain performance
- Avoid excessive resource usage
- Improve application reliability
- Support enterprise-scale operations

---

# Governor Limits

Salesforce uses governor limits to control resource usage in a multi-tenant environment.

Examples:
- SOQL query limits
- CPU time limits
- DML operation limits

These limits prevent one application from affecting others on the platform.

# Importance of Flow Governance

Proper flow governance helps:
- Reduce automation conflicts
- Improve maintainability
- Avoid recursive automation
- Increase system efficiency
- Simplify troubleshooting

# Best Practices

| Best Practice | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| Avoid unnecessary flows | Improve performance |
| Use clear flow naming | Easier maintenance |
| Limit complex automation | Reduce errors |
| Test flows properly | Ensure reliability |
| Document automation logic | Better collaboration |

# Reflection

Today I learned how approval workflows and branching logic help automate enterprise business processes.

I understood:
- How approval systems work
- How flows take different decision paths
- Why governance is important in Salesforce
- How governor limits protect system performance

The most interesting topic was learning how enterprise systems control automation using governance principles.
